				<a class="text-green-500 no-underline hover:underline" href="#">Context: </a>
				My 12-week Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) placement at Gilmour Space Technologies 
				immersed me in the world of the Gilmour Engineering and 
				Production Management Software, codenamed Chainmail. 
				This web-based Product Development Lifecycle Tool aims to 
				provide organizations developing complex multidisciplinary 
				systems with a suite of capabilities, including Functional 
				Architecture Generation, Model-based Interface Definition, and 
				Tracking Produced Component Assemblies.

			<a class="text-green-500 no-underline hover:underline" href="#">Describe: </a>
				During my placement, I was given the opportunity to 
				actively contribute to the Chainmail project. 
				My role as a software developer was instrumental in 
				enhancing the front end of this highly scalable web tool. 
				I was tasked with implementing a Tree-like Chart Component
				Structure, with features like pan and zoom control, expand, 
				and collapse of each node. In short; A full-featured Component 
				Tree Chart for Rocket Design Assembly artifact with dynamic data.

				<a class="text-green-500 no-underline hover:underline" href="#">Interpret: </a>
				Reflecting on my actions during the placement, 
				I can identify areas where different actions might have
				led to better outcomes:
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-green-500">Overemphasizing Technical Solutions: </h2>
			<p class="py-1">
				At times, I found myself overly focused on the technical 
				aspects of my tasks, trying to solve every challenge with 
				code. I now realize that some issues require a broader 
				perspective and could have benefited from more in-depth 
				discussions with team members from various disciplines.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-green-500">Limited Communication: </h2>
			<p class="py-1">
				While I actively communicated with my immediate team, I could have extended my communication efforts to other departments and teams within the organization. This would have provided a more holistic understanding of the project's objectives and potential challenges.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-green-500">Domain-Specific Knowledge: </h2>
			<p class="py-1">
				My experience in UI/UX design for Chainmail underscored the critical importance of domain-specific knowledge. Designing for Component Tree Chart which aimed to serve a niche audience, Required an understanding of intricate details that my general UI/UX design skills couldn't fully address. I learned that successful UI/UX design must be deeply rooted in the specific domain to cater to user needs effectively

				<a class="text-green-500 no-underline hover:underline" href="#">Evaluate: </a>
				These actions and realizations have provided valuable insights into my strengths and areas for improvement during my WIL placement:
			</p>
			<h1 class="text-green-500">Strengths: </h1>
			<p class="py-1">
				<h3 class="text-green-500">Continuous Learning:</h3>
				My adaptability during the placement illuminated the value of continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of technology. While I didn't have prior Vue.js experience, I was able to quickly acquire and apply this knowledge, highlighting the necessity of staying updated with emerging technologies. I learned using youtube and official docs of vue.js and D3. I used various libraries to try to understand to concept behind the walls.
			</p>
			<p class="py-1">
				<h3 class="text-green-500">Adaptability: </h3>
				I was quick to learn and apply new technologies and tools as needed, ensuring that my actions aligned with the ever-evolving requirements of the project. My ability to adapt to changing project dynamics added tangible value not only to the Chainmail project but also to my personal and professional growth. 
			</p>
			<p class="py-1">
				<h3 class="text-green-500">Collaboration:</h3>
				I participated in discussions, code reviews, and knowledge sharing within the development team. This collaborative approach positively impacted the overall progress of the Chainmail project.	
			</p>
			<br>
			<h1 class="py-1 text-green-500">Areas for Improvement: </h1>
			<p class="py-1">
				<h3 class="text-green-500">External Communication: </h3>
				Expanding my communication beyond my immediate team and actively seeking input from various stakeholders would enhance my decision-making and project understanding.
			</p>
			<p class="py-1">
				<h3 class="text-green-500">Holistic Problem-Solving: </h3>
				Broadening my approach to problem-solving by considering both technical and non-technical aspects will lead to more well-rounded solutions.
			</p>
			<p class="py-1">
				<h3 class="text-green-500">Value of Domain Knowledge: </h3>
				The UI/UX design challenge I encountered highlighted the immense value of acquiring domain knowledge. It illuminated the need for cross-disciplinary learning and collaboration to create effective solutions that resonate with end-users. This experience deepened my understanding of the crucial interplay between technical excellence and domain expertise.
